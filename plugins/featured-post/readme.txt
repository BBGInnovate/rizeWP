== Frequently Asked Questions ==
= Why was this plugin created? =
This plugin was created to for the featured post management. Its easy and any minor wordpress developer or user can use and integrate into his wordpress theme with ease.

= When I use this plugin to show featured post even when i am not adding "featured=yes" before the loop? =
This is not a common problem, but this occurs when you are have called query_posts(***."featured=yes"); before the normal template loop like in category.php or archive.php or even index.php. So, its a good practice to add a wp_reset_query(); after each custom query you make adding "featured=yes". So why not add the wp_reset_query(); after the loop of featured posts.

= What is this plugin exactly? =
As mentioned earlier, this is just a simple featured posts management plugin that adds the post meta data as featured=yes for the particular post marked as featured.

= Does This Support Custom Post Type? =
Yes, it does. To display featured post of any Custom Post Type pass the arguement `post_type=YOUR_POST_TYPE` along with `featured=yes`. For example, if I have custom post type "portfolio" and I want to show featured posts in post type "portfolio' (so called featured portfolio), then I would do, `query_posts('post_type=portfolio&featured=yes')` before the `have_posts()` loop.

= Does it work with WP_Query() class? =
Yes, absolutely, it does. you can pass it as string type arguement like `$query=new WP_Query('post_type=portfolio&featured=yes&posts_per_page=1')` or even in array type arguement like `$query=new WP_Query(array('post_type'=>'portfolio','featured'=>'yes'));` then use how the regular WP_Query is used.

= How Does it work exactly? =
This plugin actually hooks over `pre_get_posts` filter and make the WP_Query class to only fetch posts/entries which are marked featured whenever featured=yes query var is passed as query arguement(Hope that makes sense).



== Screenshots ==

1. This is how it looks like in post edit list page of wp-admin where you can mark or un-mark posts as featured.
2. Screenshot of widget control section to add Featured Post widget.
3. This is how you pass featured post variable to post loop to list featured post.
